# The greater than > operator checks if the left string has a higher 
# Unicode value than the right string. If true, the Python interpreter
# returns a True result. Since W has a Unicode value of 87, and you can 
# easily calculate that F has a Unicode value of 70, this comparison is
# the same as 87 > 70. As this is true, Python will return a True 
# result.
#True

#logical operator

print(not today == "Tuesday") 


# The "today" variable states today is Monday. This makes the comparison
# "today == Tuesday" False. The logical operator "not" inverts the False
# result to become True. In other words, this expression asks if it is
# false that today is not Tuesday. More succinctly, "not False" means 
# True."
