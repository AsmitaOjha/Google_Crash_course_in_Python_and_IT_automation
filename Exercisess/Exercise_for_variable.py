#Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.
# break=5
#Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables
birth_year=2060
current_year=2080
age=current_year-birth_year
print("My age is {}".format(age))
#Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables
first="Asmita"
middle=" "
last="Ojha"
print("My full name is: {}{}{}".format(first,middle,last))
#Answer which of these are invalid variable names: _nation 1record record1 record_one record-one record^one continue
#So, the invalid variable names are 1record, record-one, record^one, continue
